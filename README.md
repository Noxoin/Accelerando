# Accelerando

This is the code used for Group 2016.003 Accelerando, the fourth year design project for ECE Class of 2016.

# How to develop

- Each new component file must include a header (.h file) and a source (.c file).
- These files must be in the src directory (The Makefile only supports this).

# Building the code

To build the code, type make into the terminal:
```
make
```

# Running the code

To run the code, run the binary file as such:
```
./accelerando
```
